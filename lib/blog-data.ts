In today's fiercely competitive digital landscape, scaling a brand in a saturated market isn't just about visibility—it's about resonance. At YADAN Ventures, a proptech firm operating in Nigeria's fast-emerging real estate sector, I was tasked with a formidable challenge: reposition the brand and rapidly drive customer acquisition in a space dominated by legacy players and rigid perceptions.

This is the story of how a lean team, a clear vision, and a data-first approach helped us grow our customer base by over 100% in just six months, without doubling our ad spend.

## The Challenge: Marketing to the Unseen Majority

Nigeria's real estate market is notoriously fragmented. Most marketing efforts tend to target high-income urban elites. But YADAN's ambition was different. We wanted to create pathways for middle-income Nigerians to access smart, sustainable housing solutions, particularly in underserved regions. That meant rethinking how we spoke to our audience, where we reached them, and how we earned their trust.

## Step 1: Defining the "Generic User"

Before launching any campaigns, we conducted deep user segmentation across our existing leads, social followers, and walk-in queries. We coined a new persona internally called the "Generic User"—tech-curious, financially cautious, and hungry for real estate literacy. They weren't swayed by flashy marketing. They wanted practical value.

This insight led us to pivot our brand tone: we traded aspirational language for clarity, simplicity, and social proof.

## Step 2: Storytelling in a Data-Driven Context

We launched a series of hyper-targeted content campaigns built around storytelling. Through video testimonials, behind-the-scenes construction updates, and explainers on proptech benefits (like solar integration and water optimisation), we built trust and authority.

These were supported by precision-targeted paid media using Meta Business Suite, Google Ads, and programmatic retargeting. We combined platform insights with custom-built dashboards to test, refine, and scale what worked. Engagement rates jumped by 40%, and bounce rates on landing pages decreased by 25%.

## Step 3: Influencer Trust Loops

We knew our audience didn't fully trust real estate ads—but they did trust people they saw as "like them." So, we built a micro-influencer strategy around local voices in Abuja and Lagos. These weren't celebrities. They were trusted professionals—teachers, young tech workers, and lifestyle content creators.

We equipped each influencer with custom discount codes, tracked via UTM links. Conversion from influencer traffic rose 3x compared to traditional channels.

## Step 4: CRM Automation as an Accelerator

We implemented HubSpot to centralise lead management and automate follow-ups. Using behavioural tagging and funnel scoring, we tailored email content to match where users were in the decision journey.

Automated follow-ups based on site activity—like revisiting a property page—led to a 2x increase in open rates and a 50% lift in booking consultations.

## Results That Spoke for Themselves

In six months, we saw:
- 100% growth in qualified leads
- 40% increase in brand recall (measured via brand lift surveys)
- $1.8M in attributed revenue from digital channels
- A finalist spot in the African PropTech Innovation Awards

This wasn't just a marketing campaign. It was a brand reinvention anchored in audience empathy, rigorous data experimentation, and collaborative execution.

## What This Taught Me

Digital marketing isn't just about tools and tactics. It's about pattern recognition and human behaviour. It's about building bridges of trust between products and people, especially in frontier economies like Nigeria, where digital transformation is still unevenly distributed.

At YADAN, I learned that innovation isn't always loud. Sometimes, it's quiet. It's in the moments you choose to listen deeper, design smarter, and execute with empathy.

In Nigeria's fintech ecosystem, scale is everything—but so is trust. In 2020, as Digital Marketing Lead at Kalabash, I was tasked with launching and scaling a product that could easily be misunderstood: SplitPay, a deferred payment solution for online shoppers.

To make SplitPay a success, we didn't just need awareness—we needed user behavior change at scale. That meant going beyond generic advertising to engineer a campaign rooted in segmentation, psychology, and feedback loops. Within six months, we saw a 65% jump in sign-ups. This campaign would later be featured in TechPoint Africa's profile, "Women Driving Innovation in African Fintech."

Here's how we did it.

## Understanding the Friction Points

SplitPay allows users to split online purchases into smaller, interest-free payments. While this sounds intuitive in markets like the U.S. or Europe, in Nigeria it came with three barriers:

1. **Skepticism**: Nigerian users are historically wary of credit-based offerings due to fraud and lack of consumer protections.
2. **Low Financial Literacy**: Many users didn't fully understand how BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later) works.
3. **Digital Distrust**: The average user still prefers cash or POS over app-based financial tools.

So, the campaign began with a simple premise: if we wanted behavioral change, we needed to rewire how users perceived SplitPay—not as a loan, but as a flexibility tool.

## Behavioral Segmentation + UX Experiments

We divided our user base into 5 segments based on financial behavior, region, and digital fluency, derived from anonymized app analytics and survey responses.

Each segment received different messaging, onboarding flows, and ad creatives. For example:

- **Segment A (Tech-Savvy Urban Millennials)**: We used meme-style ads and gamified onboarding with social proof.
- **Segment B (Price-Conscious Parents)**: Messaging emphasized school fees and essentials, with case studies of families who benefited.

This allowed us to conduct live A/B testing across product pages, push notifications, and landing pages. We used Google Optimize and Meta Ads Manager to assess CTR and conversion deltas in real-time.

## Emotional Anchoring Through Storytelling

Instead of talking about financial jargon, we told stories: a young entrepreneur affording essential gear, a single mom managing household expenses smarter, and a university student not having to delay critical purchases.

These stories ran as a 3-part video series on Instagram and YouTube, generating over 120,000 views and over 3,000 shares. When paired with UGC (user-generated content) testimonials, the campaign saw a 45% higher engagement than our previous performance marketing efforts.

## Key Tools Used

- Google Analytics & Firebase for cohort analysis
- Mixpanel for tracking event flows and churn points
- Meta Ads Manager for demographic targeting
- Typeform for pre- and post-campaign sentiment surveys
- Tableau dashboards for reporting to stakeholders

## Measurable Outcomes

- 65% increase in app sign-ups within 6 months
- 48% reduction in customer acquisition cost (CAC)
- +2.3x return on ad spend (ROAS) across Facebook and Instagram
- Campaign featured by TechPoint Africa as a leading example of data-first marketing in African fintech

This recognition came with particular pride—not just for the results, but because it highlighted a broader truth: women in digital marketing and fintech are no longer exceptions. We're leading the conversation.

## What This Means for the Future

Fintech in Africa isn't just about building apps. It's about designing trust. SplitPay succeeded not because it had flashy features, but because we treated users as intelligent, emotional, and risk-aware.

Marketing, at its best, is translation. It translates innovation into usability, complexity into simplicity, and skepticism into belief.

As I continue to work at the intersection of technology, behavior, and storytelling, I remain committed to this ethos: make the user the hero of your narrative—and the numbers will follow.

    title: "Why Data-Driven Marketing is the Backbone of Fintech Growth in Emerging Economies",
    excerpt:
      "Insights from my Social Media Week Lagos presentation to 300+ attendees on building trust through data in Africa's fintech ecosystem.",
    publishedAt: "February 2020",
    readTime: "6 min read",
    category: "Conference",
    tags: ["Speaking", "Data Analytics", "Emerging Markets", "FinTech"],
    content: `
In February 2020, I stood on the main stage of Social Media Week Lagos, West Africa's largest tech and innovation conference, delivering a session titled "Data-Driven Marketing in Emerging Economies." I didn't just come to present slides — I came to challenge assumptions about how we think, track, and target digital users in Africa.

More than 300 attendees — from startup founders to digital marketers to technologists — gathered for the session, one of the highest-attended in the Digital Strategy track. What united us wasn't just our love for tech, but a shared challenge: how do you use data to build trust in an environment where data is scarce, fragmented, or misunderstood?

This article revisits the core of that talk — because in 2025, those lessons are still essential.

## 1. Data Is Not Just Numbers — It's Culture

Too often, startups collect data as a formality. But in emerging economies, where digital footprints are more erratic, behavioral data becomes a proxy for trust.

During my work on Kalabash's SplitPay campaign, we didn't just look at traditional KPIs like click-through rates or session duration. We looked at when users paused mid-transaction. We mapped emotional cues based on location, time, and device type. Data wasn't just about efficiency—it became a diagnostic tool for user hesitation.

This approach let us preempt friction points and redesign our onboarding flow. We eliminated jargon, added explainer animations, and created region-specific micro-campaigns. Within six months, we achieved a 65% growth in sign-ups—a figure that would later earn press coverage in TechPoint Africa.

## 2. The Rise of the Digital Middle Class

Another key theme of the talk was the emerging digital middle class — users who are tech-curious but not yet tech-literate. This segment is growing across Africa and Southeast Asia, and they require a different playbook.

I discussed our experiments with tone and format:
- Ads using formal language underperformed by 43%
- Video content outperformed static ads by 2.6x
- Conversational call-to-actions ("Want to try later?" vs. "Sign up now") yielded better long-term retention

Data was used not just to find users, but to listen to them.

## 3. Building Data Pipelines in Resource-Limited Environments

Most marketers in developed markets take data infrastructure for granted. But in many African startups, analytics tools are bolted on after launch, not built-in.

In the talk, I broke down how we created a lightweight data pipeline using open-source and low-cost tools:
- Firebase for app tracking
- Hotjar for behavior mapping
- Google Data Studio for reporting
- Custom dashboards for channel-specific ROIs

I shared how these tools helped us A/B test multiple creatives in local languages and low-bandwidth formats — without ballooning our campaign budget.

## 4. Data Storytelling and Investor Confidence

Beyond users, data also drives capital. I made the case for data storytelling — using behavioral insights and user journeys to create investor-ready narratives.

This was a key tactic we used to support YADAN Ventures' transition into a data-forward proptech brand, giving investors confidence in our direction and decision-making logic.

## 5. Cross-Border Relevance: Sharing African Learnings with the World

My closing message was simple: innovation in Africa is not behind the global curve — it's different. And our data-driven innovations are worthy of export.

From Lagos to Nairobi to Accra, marketers are solving trust, access, and literacy issues at a scale and intensity that many Silicon Valley teams never face. By sharing our frameworks, challenges, and victories, we don't just learn locally — we lead globally.

## A Moment of Recognition and Responsibility

Speaking at Social Media Week Lagos was more than a personal milestone — it was recognition that my voice mattered in shaping how digital marketing evolves across the continent. It affirmed my mission: to bridge behavioral science, marketing technology, and social good.

That session has since been cited in webinars, reposted in regional Slack groups, and adapted by early-stage accelerators in Ghana and Rwanda. I've since mentored four startups through marketing rebrands based on frameworks I introduced on that stage.

      "Strategic brand positioning and user-obsessed marketing execution that transformed an unknown startup into a market-leading proptech brand.",

In late 2021, YADAN Ventures approached me with a challenge: how do you take a promising but unknown proptech startup in Nigeria and position it as a market-leading brand? How do you attract the average Nigerian renter — skeptical, cash-conscious, digitally overloaded — and get them to not only use your platform but also trust it?

In one year, we didn't just answer that question — we doubled YADAN's customer base, redefined its brand voice, and laid the foundation for it to compete nationally.

This article outlines the strategic pillars behind that growth — and what it means for brand building in Africa's real estate tech sector.

## 1. Understanding the Nigerian Proptech Consumer

At the start, we ran discovery interviews with renters, agents, and small landlords across Lagos and Abuja. What we learned surprised us:

- Most users didn't trust listing platforms — they believed most photos were outdated or misleading.
- 80% of users relied on WhatsApp groups and informal referrals to find housing.
- Many felt alienated by the language and tone of existing proptech brands, which they saw as "for the elite."

These insights shaped everything that came next.

## 2. Brand Strategy: From Utility to Identity

We decided early on: YADAN wouldn't just be a tool — it would be a lifestyle brand grounded in accessibility and community.

Our messaging pivoted from technical features ("Smart rent-splitting!" "Verified listings!") to aspirational positioning:

**"Your Next Move, Made Simple."**

We changed the brand palette to vibrant purples and clean whites — a visual departure from the blues and grays common among competitors. Our brand voice became direct, friendly, and empathetic. We spoke with users, not at them.

## 3. Growth Through Behavioral Targeting

We designed and executed a digital campaign targeting "generic users" — everyday renters who weren't explicitly searching for proptech solutions but faced recurring pain points.

Our multi-channel strategy included:
- Instagram reels showing skits of common house-hunting struggles
- WhatsApp chatbot onboarding that mimicked human concierge-style interactions
- TikTok testimonials from micro-influencers who used YADAN to find housing
- A landlord referral program that gamified listing retention

We used Meta Pixel, Google Tag Manager, and Hotjar to collect behavioral data, then continuously iterated on content types, timing, and tone. This led to measurable shifts in funnel efficiency.

## 📈 Results:
- 100% growth in customer acquisition within 12 months
- 60% increase in user engagement across all digital channels
- A 2.3x lift in property listing retention due to improved landlord satisfaction

## 4. Trust Through Transparency

We launched a public dashboard (powered by Google Data Studio) that showed real-time metrics on verified listings, average response times, and user satisfaction ratings.

This radical transparency improved user trust and helped attract early media attention. Tech communities on Twitter reposted our dashboards. Property influencers started tagging us organically.

## 5. Brand Partnerships and Community Activation

Beyond digital, we co-hosted a housing rights Q&A series in partnership with Lagos-based law firms and ran live agent training seminars in Abuja.

We positioned YADAN as not just a product, but a platform supporting ethical real estate ecosystems.

## 6. What We Learned: Lessons for African Brand Builders

- Don't assume sophistication — build for trust and empathy.
- Tools are not brands. Emotion builds retention, not features.
- Always localize tone — what works in Lekki won't work in Kaduna.
- Measure everything, but also narrate the data in ways that inspire belief.

## A Campaign That Made a Category Leader

YADAN Ventures didn't start as the most funded or most known. But through precise brand positioning and user-obsessed marketing execution, we built momentum — not just numbers, but loyalty.

This campaign is now studied internally as a playbook. Elements of our outreach have been replicated by competitors. The company is in talks with international partners. And for me, it's a living case study in how strategic digital marketing, rooted in behavior and culture, can become a lever for exponential growth.

In Nigeria, fintech adoption has surged, yet many promising products still struggle to reach and retain users beyond early adopters. In 2020, I led the digital strategy for Kalabash's SplitPay campaign, an effort to solve that exact challenge: to grow trust and usage among everyday Nigerians for a product that split flight payments into manageable instalments.

We didn't have the largest budget. But what we had — and used well — was behavioural insight, agile testing, and a radically localised approach to messaging.

This is the story of how we grew Kalabash's fintech adoption by over 65% in six months, earning press recognition and industry attention, and what it reveals about digital marketing in emerging economies.

## 1. The Problem: High Intent, Low Conversion

SplitPay allowed customers to book flights and pay in instalments. The value proposition was clear, especially in Nigeria's economy, where bulk payments are often unaffordable.

Yet early data showed:
- Many users were abandoning the sign-up midway.
- Those who converted were often repeat users, not new ones.
- There was low engagement from lower-income regions, despite early interest.

We needed to understand what users feared and how to speak their language.

## 2. Behavioural Segmentation as a Growth Engine

Instead of traditional demographic targeting, we mapped users into five behavioural clusters using anonymised data pipelines and event tracking from Mixpanel and Meta Pixel:

- **Anxious Optimisers**: cautious users who abandoned checkout at the payment stage
- **FOMO Flyers**: social-driven users attracted by urgency or peer endorsement
- **Budget Realists**: frequent price comparers who spend time on FAQ pages
- **Mobile-first Millennials**: active on Instagram, converted via DMs or stories
- **Legacy Users**: older, email-based users who responded to trust-building copy

Each segment received tailored creatives and copy across Meta ads, WhatsApp onboarding flows, and email drip campaigns.

## 3. Multichannel Execution: Meeting Users Where They Live

We deployed a full-funnel, omnichannel campaign across:
- **Instagram Stories & Reels**: with Lagos-based influencers dramatising airport travel woes
- **WhatsApp Chatbots**: designed with emotional language and voice notes for onboarding
- **Email Series**: that demystified instalment payments with personalised examples
- **Landing Pages**: A/B-tested versions that reduced cognitive friction for each user type

We also translated core campaign assets into Pidgin English, an often overlooked move that increased completion rates by 23%.

## 4. Visual Trust as a UX Imperative

Fintech scepticism is high in Nigeria. So, we overhauled Kalabash's visual design for SplitPay pages:
- Introduced badges for security partners (Verve, NIBSS)
- Displayed testimonials with real names and routes
- Added a dynamic calculator showing payment breakdowns in real-time

We also published a "Your Rights as a SplitPay User" guide as a downloadable PDF, backed by FAQs that clearly spelt out refund policies.

## 5. Results: Growth with Retention

**Outcomes:**
- 65% increase in app sign-ups in 6 months
- 40% lower abandonment in checkout
- 32% uplift in campaign performance across behavioural segments
- Profiled by TechPoint Africa in "Women Driving Innovation in African Fintech" (Oct 2020)

The article specifically highlighted my approach to behavioural targeting and was cited by two other fintech publications afterwards.

## 6. Tools and Technologies Used

- **Mixpanel** for event analytics and user segmentation
- **Meta Pixel & Google Tag Manager** for conversion tracking
- **SendinBlue and Mailchimp** for automated drip emails
- **Figma** for UI/UX iterations
- **Google Optimise** for landing page A/B testing
- **Typeform** for post-campaign surveys and sentiment tracking

## 7. Key Takeaways: A Framework for Fintech Growth in Africa

- **Segmentation beats spray-and-pray.** Tailored campaigns convert better, especially when based on behaviour, not just identity.
- **Trust is visual.** Showing real names, logos, and proof points matters.
- **Emotional resonance matters more than technical elegance.**
- **Messaging must be multilingual.** Pidgin worked. Humour worked. So did empathy.

## A Campaign That Changed the Narrative

SplitPay went from an underused fintech feature to a credible, human-centred service. More importantly, it showed how data, empathy, and execution can bridge the trust gap between innovation and adoption in African tech.

I'm proud of the team, and proud that this work continues to influence how other startups now build, test, and scale their fintech outreach in West Africa.

In the rapidly evolving landscape of educational technology in Africa, standing out requires more than innovative offerings—it demands a compelling brand narrative that resonates across diverse markets. At ALX, our mission was to equip young Africans with the skills needed for the digital economy. However, translating this mission into widespread engagement required a strategic overhaul of our branding and communication efforts.

## Understanding the Challenge

Despite offering high-quality tech training programs, ALX faced challenges in user acquisition and engagement. Market research indicated that potential learners were either unaware of our offerings or sceptical about the value proposition. The core issues identified were:

- **Lack of Brand Awareness**: Many target users had limited exposure to ALX's programs.
- **Trust Deficit**: Scepticism towards online education platforms hindered enrollment.
- **Ineffective Communication Channels**: Traditional marketing channels were not yielding desired engagement levels.

## Strategic Interventions

To address these challenges, we implemented a multi-pronged branding strategy:

### Rebranding for Clarity and Impact
We refined our brand messaging to clearly articulate ALX's value proposition, emphasising success stories and tangible outcomes of our programs.

### Leveraging Digital Platforms
Recognising the digital savviness of our target demographic, we intensified our presence on social media platforms, utilising targeted campaigns to reach potential learners.

### Community Engagement
We initiated community-driven programs, including webinars and interactive sessions, to foster trust and provide firsthand insights into our offerings.

### Partnerships and Collaborations
Collaborating with industry stakeholders and influencers helped amplify our reach and credibility.

## Outcomes and Recognition

The strategic branding efforts yielded significant results:

- **Increased Enrollment**: We observed a 35% uptick in program enrollments within six months.
- **Enhanced Brand Visibility**: Social media engagement rates doubled, and website traffic saw a substantial increase.
- **Industry Recognition**: ALX was recognised as the most innovative edtech company in Africa, underscoring the impact of our branding initiatives.

## Conclusion

This experience underscored the pivotal role of strategic branding in scaling educational platforms. By aligning our brand narrative with the aspirations of our audience and leveraging digital channels effectively, we transformed ALX's market position, setting a precedent for edtech branding in Africa.
